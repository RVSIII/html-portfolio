<h1>The Best Movies According to Rob</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all time</h2>
<hr />
<h3>The Shawshank Redemption</h3>
<p>Believable drama.  Great characters.  Deep themes with powerful messages.</p>
<h3>Adaptation</h3>
<p>Quirky, for sure.  Best movie about writing.  Off the charts acting.</p>
<h3>Minority Report</h3>
<p>For as well-known as it is, it's still underrated as simply an amazing movie independent of its genre.</p>
